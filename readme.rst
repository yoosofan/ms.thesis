This repository presents my master thesis in Computer Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, which I completed from 2001 to 2003.

The "source" folder contains the source code of all the programs that I developed for my thesis. They are mostly written in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ 2.1, which was not a common choice for AI researchers around the world, especially in Iran, at that time.

The "data" folder includes all the data that I generated and utilized throughout the thesis.

The "KarAmoozi" folder comprises an interpreter that Mahdi Ahmadi designed to execute the pseudo grammar that I devised for simplifying my work with Persian language structure.

The "write" folder holds my assertions and related files.

".utx" files can be opened by any new unicode supported editors these days. But at that time, "Sc Unipad" was one of the best and freeware options to fully support unicode. You can download this very old, yet useful, editor for windows from the following websites.
